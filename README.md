# Personal Dashboard

This is a clone of the Google Momentum Browser Extension Dashboard  - [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en "Momentum")

Leading up to the build up of the page I worked with various APIs while paying attention to Promise Rejections and Error Handling

Basically, It's the default page that will pop up once a user opens up a new tab on google chrome

Free APIs used in the project are :
 - Unsplash photos API
 - Crypto currencies API
 - Weather API
 - Random Quotes/Advice API 
 - Sports API for the EPL Table standings 


### Other Features to add :
 - Enable image caching
 - Include SameSite cookie attribute
 - Placeholder Icons or Spinners
 - Responsiveness in from Medium screen sizes 
 - Text Contrast

***The Project hasn't been added to Google Chrome Extensions however curious developers are welcome to try this out. Find out more info on the below link***
